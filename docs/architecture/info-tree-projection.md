# Info-tree projection

Two sibling session methods project a processed Lean source into the
[`ProcessedFile`](../../crates/lean-rs-host/src/host/process/info_tree.rs) value type: four arrays of structurally
distinct nodes (commands, terms, tactics, name references) plus the diagnostics the elaborator emitted. The two methods
answer different questions and live behind different Lean shim exports, but share the projection walker verbatim:

| Method | Lean shim | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LeanSession::process_with_info_tree` | `lean_rs_host_process_with_info_tree` | Body-only snippet, no header. The shim runs `IO.processCommands` from byte 0 with an empty `ModuleParserState`. Right for inline scratch buffers, prompt-05 fixture tests, and tactic-level snippets. |
| `LeanSession::process_module_with_info_tree` | `lean_rs_host_process_module_with_info_tree` | Full Lean source file (header + body). The shim calls `Lean.Parser.parseHeader` first and resumes `IO.processCommands` from the parser state the header parser produced. Positions in the returned projection land in the original file's line/column system. Right for real-file inputs from `lean-host-mcp` and downstream position tools. |

The four downstream queries (`goal_at_position`, `type_at_position`, `references_of_name`, `term_at`) are unblocked by
either method — they consume the shared `ProcessedFile`. Per POSD ch 6.1, both interfaces stay general-purpose (source,
options, cancellation → outcome); the projection's *functionality* serves the cursor-query set but its interface
doesn't encode any of them. Per POSD ch 9 "better apart", the two methods are split because they answer different
questions (snippet vs. file), not because they share a flag — folding into one shim with a `mode` parameter would push
the choice into every caller.

## What the projection carries

Every node carries an explicit `(start_line, start_column, end_line, end_column)` source range — 1-based at every layer,
matching Lean's `Position` convention. Bodies are owned strings and primitive integers only, so a `ProcessedFile` is
`Send + Sync + 'static` and crosses worker-thread channels cleanly.

| Node | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `CommandInfoNode` | One top-level command. `decl_name` is set for declaration commands (`def`, `theorem`, `instance`, …) and `None` for others (`#check`, `open`, comment-only fragments). |
| `TermInfoNode` | One `Lean.Elab.TermInfo` node — an elaborated expression with raw `Expr.toString` text plus the inferred type. `expected_type_str` is set where the elaborator recorded a coercion target. |
| `TacticInfoNode` | One `Lean.Elab.TacticInfo` node — the tactic's source range plus already-pretty-printed `goals_before` / `goals_after`. Goal strings come from `Lean.Meta.ppGoal` inside the elaboration's MetaM context, so no metavariable identity has to cross the FFI. |
| `NameRefNode` | One identifier occurrence. `is_binder` distinguishes binding sites from use sites — the same distinction Lean's LSP uses to answer "go to definition" vs. "find references". |

The diagnostics field reuses the host stack's `LeanElabFailure` shape, so callers branch through the same
`diagnostics()` / `truncated()` accessors as `LeanSession::kernel_check`.

## What the projection does *not* carry

Raw `Lean.Expr` values, metavariable contexts, and `Elab.InfoTree` nodes themselves all stay behind the FFI boundary on
purpose. They carry references the Rust side cannot revive outside the elaboration session that produced them —
projecting to strings + ranges is what keeps the cross-thread guarantee. Callers that need notation-aware text for a
specific expression use the optional `lean_rs_host::meta::pp_expr` service against the captured expression on the Lean
side, not the projection.

The shim is also explicitly **not** incremental in v1. Every call re-runs `Lean.Elab.IO.processCommands` against the
supplied source — the same path Lean's LSP server uses for each `didChange`. Incremental reuse is a v0.3 optimisation
when there is profile data to justify it. Per-command progress reporting is similarly deferred: every prompt-06 cursor
query operates on one buffer per call, so adding a `_progress` sibling shim would double the symbol contract for a
hypothetical use case.

## Outcome shape

`process_with_info_tree` returns a two-arm `ProcessFileOutcome` (`Processed` + `Unsupported`). The header-aware
`process_module_with_info_tree` returns a four-arm `ProcessModuleOutcome`:

- `Ok { file, imports }` — header parsed; every user-written import is present in the session's open env's
  transitive module closure; the body was processed.
- `MissingImports { file, imports, missing }` — header parsed but some imports name modules absent from the env's
  transitive closure. The body still elaborated; the projection is populated. Soft failure — callers typically
  surface it as a warning.
- `HeaderParseFailed { diagnostics }` — `Lean.Parser.parseHeader` reported error-severity messages.
  `IO.processCommands` was not run.
- `Unsupported` — the loaded capability dylib does not export the new symbol. No FFI call was made.

The "missing imports" check compares against `env.header.moduleNames` (the transitive closure), not
`env.header.imports` (only direct imports). Otherwise a session that imports `LeanRsHostShims.Elaboration` —
which transitively pulls in `Lean` — would flag every `import Lean` in user files as missing.

## Optional capability

Both shim symbols are declared **optional** in the
[capability contract](../lean-rs-host-capability-contract.md). A fork of the shim package that omits either symbol
still loads cleanly; the corresponding session method returns its `Unsupported` arm at dispatch time without
invoking the FFI. The pattern matches the five `MetaM` services that already use this degradation path
(`LeanMetaResponse::Unsupported`).

## Position helpers

`ProcessedFile` exposes three inherent helpers so cursor consumers do not reinvent the range walk:

- `term_at(line, column) -> Option<&TermInfoNode>` — innermost containing term node.
- `tactic_at(line, column) -> Option<&TacticInfoNode>` — innermost containing tactic node.
- `references_of(name) -> Vec<&NameRefNode>` — every identifier occurrence whose fully-qualified name matches exactly.

"Innermost" is defined by source-range area: lines are weighted heavily so cross-line ranges always dominate single-line
ranges. Ties on the same line break by column span. These helpers are pure Rust — no Lean call.
