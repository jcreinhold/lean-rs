//! Session pooling for amortising `Lean.importModules` across reused
//! environments.
//!
//! Re-importing the Lean prelude is the dominant FFI cost on the host
//! stack — measured on a dev macOS rig at roughly 4×–5× the cost of
//! reusing an existing session (see the `session_reuse_amortises_import`
//! timing note in `host/tests.rs`). [`SessionPool`] keeps a bounded
//! free-list of previously imported `Lean.Environment` values keyed by
//! their imports list; on [`SessionPool::acquire`], a matching entry is
//! popped and rewrapped under the caller-supplied
//! [`crate::host::LeanCapabilities`] borrow, and on
//! [`PooledSession::drop`], the environment goes back to the pool (or is
//! released if capacity is full).
//!
//! ## Capability-agnostic storage
//!
//! Entries store the bare imported environment as
//! `Obj<'lean>` (a refcounted handle to the Lean
//! `Environment` value), not a full [`crate::LeanSession`]. The session
//! borrows from the capability via `'c`; storing one in the pool would
//! tie the pool's lifetime to a single capability borrow. Storing the
//! bare environment instead lets each [`SessionPool::acquire`] thread a
//! fresh capability borrow without touching `'lean`. Environments are
//! Lean values bound to the runtime, not to the capability that imported
//! them, so this rewrapping is semantically free.
//!
//! ## Capacity policy
//!
//! [`SessionPool::with_capacity`] sets a hard upper bound on the
//! free-list size. On release, if the pool is at capacity, the
//! environment is dropped immediately (its `Obj<'lean>`
//! `Drop` runs `lean_dec` and the underlying allocation is freed). The
//! free list is FIFO on `take` and LRU on `push`, so the most
//! recently-released environment is the next to be reused — hot OS
//! caches stay warm. There is no eviction-by-age or eviction-by-distinct-key
//! policy beyond the capacity bound.
//!
//! [`SessionPool::drain`] explicitly drops every cached free-list entry
//! without discarding the pool itself. It releases the Rust-owned
//! environment references the pool is holding; it does not reset Lean's
//! process-global runtime state, module initializer flags, interned
//! names, compacted `.olean` regions, or allocator arenas.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! [`SessionPool`] is `!Send + !Sync` (inherited from the contained
//! `Obj<'lean>` and the `RefCell` that wraps the free list). The pool
//! is a per-thread reuse helper; cross-thread pooling is explicitly
//! out of scope. Per-pool stats are `Cell<PoolStats>` —
//! single-threaded but uniform with the per-session
//! [`crate::host::session::SessionStats`] story.
